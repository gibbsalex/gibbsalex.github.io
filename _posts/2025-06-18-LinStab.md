Process for determining stability of a linear system.

1. set f(x) = 0 to find x_f, Finding the equilibrium points
2. deferentiate w.r.t. to x, Linearize the system/find Jacobian
3. plug in f'(x_f), test stability at x_f
- if f'(x_f) < 0, system is stable and decays
- if f'(x_f) > 0, system is unstable and exponentiall grows
- if f'(x_f) = 0, system is a saddle point


Differentiating the system dynamics determines how trajectories in the area behave in state space.
