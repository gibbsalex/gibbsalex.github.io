Iteratively propogate forward a differential equation with these methods.

Stiff ODE's require special attention, because some explicit methods might incorrectly estimate the solution. This can cause a stable ODE to appear unstable.

$$
\frac{dy}{dt}_n \approx \frac{y_{n+1} - y_n}{h} = -y_n^2
$$
where: 
h is time step size, n is the time step

# Explicit
## Explicit Euler Method

$$
y_{n+1} = y_n + h \times f(t_n, y_n)
$$

## Runge-Kutta Method (RK4)

Weighted sum of derivate estimates

$$
y_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2 k_2 + 2 k_3 + k_4)
$$
where k's are estimates of derivatives

# Implicit
## Implicit Euler Method

$$
y_{n+1} + h y_{n+1}^2 = y_n
$$

use the quadratic formula:

$$
y_{n+1} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 h y_n}}{2 h}
$$

Necessary to use a root-finding algorithm to estimate, such as newton's method.

## Crank-Nicholson Method

Finite difference method = approximate derivates with finite differences
