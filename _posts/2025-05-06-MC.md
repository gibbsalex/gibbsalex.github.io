MC simulation and unit testing a system help verify control system requirements (V&V)

Goal is to determine an output when random variables are present

Repeat the dynamics as simulations, asses the final state of a variety of answers to determine the probability.

The key to Monte Carlo is that it tests a bunch of random variables and averages them.

Procedure:
1. Generate a domain of inputs with known probability distribution
2. Deterministically compute outputs by simulating dynamics
3. Compare results with expected/average value


See the circle_area_mc.py demo for a simple implementation where I estimate the area of circle without pi * r^2
