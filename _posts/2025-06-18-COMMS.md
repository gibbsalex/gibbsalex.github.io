# Common Serial Protocols

Serial ports transmit data one bit at a time

### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

#### Synchronous -> SPI, I2C, USB

Clock line requried

#### Asynchronous -> UART, RS-232

Relies on start/stop bits and timing. Must agree on a clock speed and stick to it. Also communication can only be done in a one to one interaction.

## UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)

Use: device-to-device communication

wire: 2 (TX, RX) / Transmit and Recieve

## SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)

Use: Fast communication with peripherals (SD cards, displays)

wire: 4 (MISO, MOSI, SCLK, SS)

Designed for high-speed communication between ICs

Topology: Primary-secondary

Hardware-level, no complex stack

SD card, temperature sensor, OLED display

One controller on the bus but we can add an arbitrarily large amount of peripherals.

## I2C (Inter-Integrated Circut)

Use: Communicating with sensors, EEPROMS, Real Time Clock

wire: 2 (SDA, SCL)

Blends the simplicity of 2 wires, with the synchronous communication speed.

Allows for integrated circuits to communicate with one or more controller chips. But each controller must take turns talking on the bus.

For every 8-bits of data sent, there must be one extra bit for meta data ("ACK/NACK")

Message structure: Start Condition, Address Frame(where), Data Frame(what), Stop Condition.

## USB (Universal Serial Bus)

Use: PC-to-device

wire: 4 (VCC, GND, D+, D-)

Designed for universal connection for external devices.

Topology: One host, multiple devices

Requires drivers, descriptors

Can send power to devices

Mouse, keyboard, USB flash drive

## CAN (Controller Area Network)

Use: Automotive & industrial systems

wire: 2 (CAN_H, CAN_L)


## Single Wire

Communicating with a sensor likely goes through an ADC

ADC = Analog to Digital Converter

In(analog voltage) -> system -> Out(analog signal) -> computer reads the digital signal

Example: potentiometers change resistance which affects the output voltage of the system. The output voltage goes to the ADC port to be read by the computer/controller.
