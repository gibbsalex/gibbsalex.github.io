Quantitative Behavior of a system.

The shape of the Bode will tell us something about the order.

Notch frequencies occur

### Gain Margin
Stability

What: about of gain increase required to make the open-loop system unstable
When: stability assesment
Where: measured at the phase crossover frequency - where phase = 0 or -180deg
Why:
How:

Stability rule: High GM = more stable against gain changes

### Phase Margin

What: the phase lag needed to bring the system to the verge of instability
When:
Where: measured at the gain crossover frequency - where gain = 0db or mag = 1
Why:
How:

Stability rule: high PM = more damping and robustness

### Ground Rules for Behavior

Zeros speed up the system.

Poles slow down the system.

#### Lead vs. Lag Compensators

### Design Requirements to Closed Loop Pole locations on the Root Locus

Time Constant(determined from dynamics):
$$
\tau
$$

10% to 90% rise time is t_ra
$$
t_{ra} \approx 2.2 \tau
$$

natural frequency (radians)
$$
\omega_n = \frac{1.8}{t_r} 
$$

damping zeta, max overshoop Mp
$$
\zeta \gtrsim 0.5 \rightarrow M_p \leq 15\% \\

\zeta \gtrsim 0.7 \rightarrow M_p \leq 5% 

\zeta \approx \frac{PM}{100}\\
