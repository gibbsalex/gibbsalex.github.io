## 7. Lunar Trajectories

### Earth-Moon System
The Earth and the Moon revolve around their common center of mass. 3/4 of the way out from the Earth's center of mass. The Earth revolves around the common center of mass every 27.5 days.

The Moon's period of revolution around the Earth is equal to the period of rotation around it's axis. The same side of the Moon always faces the Earth.

Earth-Moon Trajectores: Precise lunar trajectories consider the oblate shape of the Earth, solar perturbations, solar pressure, and Moon gravity.

Set up initial conditions position, velocity, then integrate forward with RungeKutta to hit the Moon.

Insertion speed changes the path to the moon from straight in,to hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic. Reduce the speed until the satellite is within the Moon's grav pull. Consider the trade offs of time of flight, and insertion speed.
