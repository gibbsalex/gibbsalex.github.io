## Algebraic Riccati Equation for LQR

The cost function for an infinite-horizon:

$$ J = \int_0^\infty[x^T Q x + u^T R u]dt\\
Q \geq 0\\
R > 0
$$

Find the optimal cost-to-go function $J^*(x)$ that solves this:

$$
0 = \min_u [x^T Q x + u^T R u + \frac{\partial J^*}{\partial x}(Ax + B u)]
$$

The solution is:

$$
J^*(x) = x^T S x
$$

The gradient of the function is

$$
\frac{\partial J^*}{\partial x} = 2 x^T S
$$

The min of the cost junction will be where the terms equal zero because they are quadratic and convex

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial u} = 2 u^T R + 2 x^T S B = 0
$$

solve for $ u $ :

$$
u^* = -R^{-1} B^T S x = \pi^*(x) = -K x 
$$

plug back into our min function

$$
0 = x^T [Q - S B R^{-1} B^T S + 2 S A]x
$$

once we simplify by symmetric terms, we reveal the algebraic riccati equation in continuous time

$$
0 = S A + A^T S - S B R^{-1} B^T S + Q
$$
