## Initial Value Problem

known:
$$
y(t_0) = \# \\

y'(t_0) = \#
$$


## Boundary Value Problem
Represented by a differential equation, with applied boundary constraints.

$$
y(t_0) = \# \\

y(t_f) = \#
$$

### Constraint:
1. well-posed: "given an input to the system, there is a unique output, which depends continuously on the input"
