### Intro
Celestial Mechanics - the study of the motions of moons and planets

Orbital Mechanics - the study of motion of moons + space vehicles. Common distrubances: gravity, motor thrusts, atmospheric drag, solar winds, vehicle trajectory, and more.

Basis in physics laws with added affects from general relativity(post-Newtonian).

### Coordinate Systems and Frames
It is necessary to declare the time and space coordinate of the object with respect to an observer

### Two-Body Motion
Kepler's Laws(1609) describing the motion of planets:
1. The orbits of planets are ellipses, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. (ellipse paths)
2. The line joining the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times as the planet travels around the ellipse. (planets cover the same distance anywhere in the path)
3. The ratio of the squares of the periods of revolution for two planets is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their semimanjor axes. (speed to radius calc)

Only works for problems with two objects interacting.

Newton's Laws of Motion(1687):
1. Objects at rest remain at rest. Objects in motion remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force. (mv(before) = mv(after))
2. An applied force to an object is equal to the time rate of change of momentum of the object. (F = ma)
3. For every action there is an equal an opposite reaction. (F = -F)
4. Every object in the universe attracts every other body in the universe through their center line.

$$
F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{d^2}
$$

More useful for multiple-body problems.
