Quantitative Behavior of a system.

The shape of the Bode will tell us something about the order.

Notch frequencies occur

### Gain Margin
Stability

What: about of gain increase required to make the open-loop system unstable
When: stability assesment
Where: measured at the phase crossover frequency - where phase = 0 or -180deg
Why:
How:

Stability rule: High GM = more stable against gain changes

### Phase Margin

What: the phase lag needed to bring the system to the verge of instability
When:
Where: measured at the gain crossover frequency - where gain = 0db or mag = 1
Why:
How:

Stability rule: high PM = more damping and robustness
