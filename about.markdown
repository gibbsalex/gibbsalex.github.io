- Vehicle Flight Dynamics and Control.
- Design and implement flight control algorithms to stabilize a rocket-shaped drone. 
- Thrust vector control using a servo motor actuated gimbal.
- Collect and record data from potentiometers to verify gimbal motor behavior.
- Implement a laser range finder to determine vehicles vertical distance from ground.
- Utilize onboard IMU data to determine vehicle's attitude.
- Design and implementation of 6 SISO Lead-Lag controllers for each degree of freedom.

- Write the software stack to control a small mobile robot.
- Build, and tune, a motion control node to implement PID controller to reach a global position and orientation. PID acts as a closed-loop feedback controller to close the distance between its current location and its desired location.
- Build a Kalman Filter node to update the estimate of the current vehicle's belief in its state (orientation + position) 

## Microsoft(Contract):

Validated new and existing controller designs.


#### Devices Team — Reliability Test Engineer (REL)
Worked on the Microsoft Laptop, Tablets, Headphones, HoloLens.
Conducted device testing to evaluate device lifecycle. 
Tested vibration, temperature humidity, water immersion, shock, impact testing.
Investigated the use of a 6-axis robotic arm to automate the process of opening and closing the Surface Studio hinge.
Captured and analyzed IMU data from a Field Test Engineer to investigate the feasibility of recreating the motion inside the lab.

## Strategic Robotics Systems
